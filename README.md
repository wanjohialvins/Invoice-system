## 🎨 Customization

### Company Information & Rates

You can easily configure company details, freight rates, and currency conversion rates directly from the **Settings** page in the application.

1. **Navigate to Settings** from the sidebar.
2. **Company Info**: Update name, address, phone, email, PIN, and logo.
3. **Invoice Settings**: Configure default rates (Freight, Currency), toggle header/footer visibility, and manage PDF options (Watermark, Barcode).
4. **System**: Manage data persistence and reset options.

Changes made in the Settings page are saved locally and will be reflected in all new invoices and PDF documents.
